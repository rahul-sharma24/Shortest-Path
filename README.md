# Shortest-Path
**Project Description:** This project is a visualization and navigation tool for a network of interconnected stations. It allows users to find the shortest path between two stations and view relevant information about the stations and connections with help of Dijkastra theorem.
## Table of Contents

- ## Introduction

Our project provides a user-friendly interface for exploring a network of stations and finding the shortest path between them. It's particularly useful for transit systems, campus maps, or any scenario where navigating a network of interconnected locations is necessary.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Users can interact with the map, click on stations, and find the shortest path between them.
- **Station Information:** Users can view station details, including names and associated information.
- **Shortest Path:** The application calculates and displays the shortest path between two selected stations.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** The network is dynamically visualized with adjustable edges and distances.
- **User-Friendly:** The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

#Running The Application
-start the application.
-Hover your mouse over the starting station. Click the "Start" button that appears.

-Hover your mouse over the destination station. Click the "End" button that appears.

-The application will automatically display the shortest path between the selected stations.

#How Dijkstra's Algorithm is Used
Dijkstra's algorithm is employed in this project to calculate the shortest path between two stations within the network. It works by iteratively selecting the station with the minimum distance from the starting station and updating the distances to its neighbors. This process continues until the shortest path to the destination station is found.
